    If you're new here, we strongly recommend checking this section first so you learn Kairos' fundamentals and launch your first deployment :rocket:

Whether you are a seasoned systems engineer, or just tipping your toes in this world. We have prepared this section to explain the basics of Kairos, our goals and features. I hope you're wearing your gloves because we will also get our hands dirty by doing a deployment of Kairos on a virtual machine.

The following sections are divided in theory and practice, and you can consume them in any order you prefer.

We hope you enjoy your experience with Kairos and remember, as an open-source project, you are always welcome to join our community and be part of this project.
